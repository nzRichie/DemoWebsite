                    <p>The HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol lays the very foundation of the web as we know it, 
                        enabling billions of users from across the globe access to content to millions of websites. 
                        Specifically, it is used to load web pages through the use of hypertext links. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Request-Response</h3>
                    <p>HTTP(S) is a request-response protocol, meaning that users will send a request to the server which will then provide a response. 
                        HTTP has many different types of <a href="request.html">requests</a> that can be used to perform specific actions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Application layer</h3>
                    <p>HTTP is an application layer protocol and functions on top of the other layers in the networking protocol stack. 
                        The HTTP protocol is not responsible for finding a path to and from the destination server, only for making the desired request. 
                        The to and from is handled by other protocols further down the network stack.</p>
                    
                        <h3>HTTP vs. HTTPS</h3>
                    <p>HTTPS adds an extra layer of security to the HTTP protocol. By default, HTTP sends messages in plain text that could 
                        potentially be intercepted and read by anyone along the path the packet takes. This could enable bad actors to 
                        easily gain access to sensitive information such as passwords or private communications. HTTPS takes steps to prevent this by 
                        encrypting the packets using Transport Layer Security (TLS) which replaced Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) as the protocol for 
                        HTTPS security (although the certificates used are still named SSL certificates).</p>
                    <p>TLS uses public key cryptography which enables both the client and server to agree on a shared secret key that is used to 
                        encrypt communications so they are unable to be read by any malicious parties.</p>

                    <h3>How TLS works:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Client sends an TLS connection request which contains the TLS version the client wants to use.</li>
                        <li>Server acknowledges the client&apos;s connection request, and provides a valid SSL certificate.</li>
                        <li>Client verifies the server&apos;s SSL certificate with the SSL authority who issued it.</li>
                        <li>The client sends a random string of bytes called the “premaster secret" encrypted by the server's public key that it obtained from the SSL certificate.</li>
                        <li>The server decrypts the premaster secret with its private key.</li>
                        <li>Both the client and the server generate a shared session key based on the premaster secret.</li>
                        <li>Both parties exchanged a “finished” message encrypted with the new shared key.</li>
                        <li>Secure symmetric encryption has been achieved!</li>
                    </ul>
