                    <h2>HTTP Requests</h2>
                    <p>HTTP Requests are the messages that are sent from the client to the server. These are used to perform various actions such as requesting content from the server, or updating content on the server.</p>
                    <p>Requests all have headers, which are used to convey information to the server such as the HTTP method, information about the client being used to connect, what type of responses are accepted by the client, and many more. The first part of the header will look something like this:</p>
                    <p>GET /index.html HTTP/1.1</p>
                    <p>GET refers to the HTTP method the client is using, /index.html refers to the file being requested by the client, and HTTP/1.1 refers to the version of HTTP being used in the request.</p>
                    <h2>Types of HTTP methods:</h2>
                    <p>Below is a table containing all of the different types of HTTP methods and what they're used for.</p>
