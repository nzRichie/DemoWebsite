                    <p>In this page we will explore the difference between the HTTP methods GET and POST, and in what situations to use them effectively. Let&apos;s start by looking at each method in more detail before comparing the two.</p>
                    <h3>GET:</h3>
                    <p>The GET method is used to request the data from a specified resource. When the GET method is used the contents of the request are stored in the URL:</p>
                    <p>index.html?nameX=valueX&nameY=valueY</p>
                    <p>Let&apos;s break down what&apos;s going on here. The nameX and nameY both refer to elements on the webpage that take user input, these could be a textbox, checkbox, password field, etc. valueX and valueY refer to the data that has been input in those fields by the user. So for example, if a website had a textbox with the name favoriteFood and the user input Macaroni we would see this appear in the URL:</p>
                    <p>index.html?favoriteFood=Macaroni</p>
                    <p>This is commonly used when requesting data from the website for instance using a search bar to find a resource on the website.</p>
                    <h3>POST:</h3>
                    <p>So how is POST different from GET? Well, POST puts the data that has been input in the body of the HTTP request. Using the example above, an HTTP request may look something like this:</p>
                    <pre style="white-space: pre-line;">
                        POST /index.html HTTP/1.1
                        Host: mywebsite.com
                        â€¦
                        favoriteFood=Macaroni
                    </pre>
                    <p>POST is used to send data to the server to update/create a resource and is not displayed in the URL. This is useful for things like usernames and passwords, where we don&apos;t want sensitive information being displayed in the URL.</p>
                    <h3>Some other key differences:</h3>
                    <p>Using the back/reload button to navigate to a page that was loaded using the POST request will resubmit the data in the forms. The browser will usually warn users about this. For GET it is harmless, however.</p>
                    <p>Because GET adds things into the URL, it is limited by the URL max length which is 2048 characters long. However since POST includes the data in the body of the HTTP request, it is not limited by size.</p>
                    <p>GET parameters are saved in browser history, whereas POSTs are not.</p>
                    <p>GET can only send ascii characters to the server, as those are the only characters allowed in a URL. POST can send binary data and can be used to upload files to a server.</p>
                    <p>POST is more secure for things like login credentials because it is not stored in browser history or web server logs. This makes it the safer option to use for sensitive data.</p>
