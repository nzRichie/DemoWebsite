                    <p>The above image shows all the HTTP requests that were made while loading this <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/">webpage</a>. As we can see, all the requests are of the type GET, this is because the client is attempting to download all the resources required to display the webpage. Let's break down what exactly is being downloaded here.</p>
                    <p>Firstly we will see what all the different columns mean in the table below:</p>

                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Column</th>
                            <th>Description</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Status</td>
                            <td>Status refers to the HTTP response sent by the server. As we can see all of the responses here were 200 or OK. This means that the file was successfully requested.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Method</td>
                            <td>Refers to the method being used by the HTTP request. All the methods here were GET.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Domain</td>
                            <td>The target domain of the request. As we can see most of the requests were sent to the firefox-source-docs.mozilla domain, which is the host of the website.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>File</td>
                            <td>The specific URL to the file being requested.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Initiator</td>
                            <td>This is the object or process that initiated the request.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Type</td>
                            <td>The type of document being requested</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Transferred</td>
                            <td>The total amount of data that was transferred for this request.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Size</td>
                            <td>The size of the target file.</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>

                    <h2>The sequence of requests:</h2>
                    <p>The first request we see is for the .html file that comprises the structure of the webpage. This is loaded first because it contains links to all of the other files that are required to load the webpage. Once the client has this, then it will read the html file and send further requests to gather the additional content.</p>
                    <p>The next series of requests shown above are downloading the CSS required to style the page. As we can see this page is using 6 separate stylesheets to format the content contained within the html file. Each one of these files requires are separate HTTP request from the client in order to download it.</p>
                    <p>Following the stylesheets, the next objects that were loaded were the javascript files. These are responsible for website functionality. It is likely that the javascript files are split up based on what their individual purposes are.</p>
                    <p>Next up are the image files. Each image file has to be individually requested by the client. We can see that two filetypes fall under the umbrella of image files: .svg, and .png. There exist other file types which fall under this category such as .gif and .jpg</p>
                    <p>The final file we see down the very bottom is actually a font file. It is possible for websites to use custom fonts or even to link to externally hosted fonts using services such as Google Fonts. Clients will download and temporarily store these fonts locally in order to display them on the webpage.</p>
